        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This manti recipe takes a little time to prepare, but I'm sure you'll agree it's worth it! Manti is a famous meal from my country. Afiyet olsun (bon appetit)!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 onions, peeled</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) container plain yogurt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a mixing bowl. Add eggs and water, mixing well with your hands. Add more water, if needed, to form a soft dough. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Shred onions and place them in a colander or sieve set over a bowl; drain and discard juice. Combine drained onion, ground beef, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix well with a spoon until mashed. Set filling aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a work surface and a large plate.

            </li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Working with one piece at a time, roll dough on the floured surface into a rectangle, as thin as you can. Cut into 2-inch squares with a knife or pastry wheel.

            </li>
            <li>Place about 2 teaspoons meat filling in the center of each square. Gather the edges of dough and pinch them together at the top to form a bundle. Transfer manti to the prepared plate; sprinkle more flour on top to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Heat oil and red pepper flakes in a small skillet over low heat just until pepper flakes begin to color oil. Remove from heat and keep warm. Stir together yogurt and minced garlic in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook manti in boiling water until filling is no longer pink and dough is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Divide manti onto 4 plates. Spoon yogurt sauce over manti and drizzle each serving with warm red pepper oil.</li>
        </ol>
